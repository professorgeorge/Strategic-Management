          <p style={S.prose}>
            Strategic management is not a collection of separate frameworks applied in sequence. It is a discipline of integrated, simultaneous judgment. In this simulation, your choice in the analysis stage shaped what was available in planning; your planning choice determined what implementation demanded of you; your implementation decisions set the context for the partnership and technology choices that followed. This is how strategy actually works in practice — decisions are never isolated.
          </p>

          <h2 style={S.h2}>As a Professional</h2>
          <p style={S.prose}>
            Whether you work in a large corporation, a growth-stage business, a public organisation, or a family enterprise, the same integrative logic applies. The strategic leaders who consistently outperform are those who hold near-term execution and long-term positioning simultaneously, who treat analytical frameworks as lenses rather than checklists, and who understand that strategy lives or dies in implementation. This course has given you the vocabulary, the frameworks, and — through these simulations — the practised intuition to function as one of those leaders.
          </p>

          <h2 style={S.h2}>In Personal Life</h2>
          <p style={S.prose}>
            The same principles that make organisations strategic make individuals strategic. Understanding your own competitive position, making deliberate choices about where to invest your time and energy, building alliances, managing risk with clear triggers, and holding a long-range view of where you want to be — these are life skills as much as professional ones. The strategist's mindset is not something you leave at the office.

              <strong>A final note:</strong> The most important outcome of this course is not that you can recall frameworks, but that you have developed the habit of standing above the immediate pressure and asking: what is actually going on here, what are my real options, and what decision today will I be most glad I made in five years?
